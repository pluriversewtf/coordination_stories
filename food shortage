food shortage occurs when food supplies within a bounded region do not provide the energy and nutrients needed by that region's population. we have so many people in the world who cannot provide for themselves. 

Food shortage may occurÂ  when not enough food is produced, such as when crops fail due to drought, pests, or too much moisture. But the problem can also result from the uneven distribution of natural resource endowment for a country, and by human institutions, such as government and public policy.


to reduce food shortage we need incorporates a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factors including droughts, shipping disruptions, fuel shortages, economic instability, and wars.
