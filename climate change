As the surveillance camera scanned my face, I made a break for it. It was 3:46, and I had to give a presentation on our general AI to my director and a few other company executives at 4. The same topic was scheduled for an online event the following day, and it wasn't ready. We expected this presentation to be complete, ready to be delivered to the company's spokesperson. When I hurried into the meeting room, I noticed that five people were staring at me. Mrs. Lisa, the boss, greeted me with a grin and said: "Kevin, good morning. It's clear you're making an effort to meet the targets we've set. The presentation is with you, right?‚Äù The spokesperson frowned and said, "Mr. Richard." "As of a week ago, I should have had access to the full presentation. I really should get ready for this."

Mrs. Lisa faced him for a moment. "I've seen you wing a presentation before, and it went over so well that we ended up hiring you. The presentation will be sent to you as soon as it's completed. But even if it isn't, you can always make do and still bring in a tidy sum." Seeing the company's upper management bicker over something I had helped create was embarrassing. Therefore, I expressed my regrets by saying: "I'm sorry, Mr. Richard, but the public relations team insisted we include all of our ongoing projects, not just the one to reverse global warming. Last night they asked me to take on five more projects."

"What? Why? The Reversal of Global Warming is our finest achievement; it has the potential to save the lives of every person on Earth. What's the point in promoting our other projects before they've proven themselves?"

In the midst of Mr. Lisa's speech, I was preparing to project the charts onto the smart wall. While plugging my phone into the wall, I replied, "That's what I'd said, but they say since our company is a non-profit international company funded by every country that agreed to the Ethical AI accord, we should show the world that we are working to enhancing the everyday life of everyday people." Saving the world won't make everyone happier?

Somebody said, "They want more concrete projects." To avoid giving the presentation, I projected my phone onto the smart wall and instead we had a conversation about getting it ready "You'll find information about how to stop global warming on these slides. A general rise in the Earth's average temperature, known as global warming, is a process of climate change that has long-term effects on ecosystems and weather patterns. It is closely related to how much more greenhouse gases are present in our atmosphere, which exacerbates the greenhouse effect. This article provides a high-level introduction to the topic, covering such topics as what it is, why it's important, the technology we're using, and how artificial intelligence (AI) contributed to our understanding of what we could and should do."

Mrs. Lisa got out of her chair and put her hands on my shoulders: "Emma, you need to slow down a bit. More than 32 hours remain for us to complete this. I assure you that everything will turn out fine." That woman has my undying love. She single-handedly raises the prestige of all global bosses. I took a deep breath, calmed down, and went on: "The temperature has dropped by one degree in just the last five years, as shown by these graphs, reversing the trend of global warming. Obviously, even if we get back to the preindustrial era's worldwide average temperature, there are nonetheless damages that we could not overturn. Just like the ice caps' sweet waters that have drained into the sea. The greenhouse effect occurs naturally. However, human activity is responsible for the rise in greenhouse gases. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the top climate scientists in the world think that human activities are almost certainly the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century, mostly due to: overconsumption, deforestation, mining, intensive farming, waste disposal, fossil fuels. These factor will continue to hurt our oceans, weather and biodervisity. Nonetheless, it's a million times better than anything we had even just five years ago." Mr. Richard's assistant, Elon, jotted a note to his boss on his phone, saying, "I can hire a graphic artist visualize these metrics, to be exhibited while you talk about that as well."

"They desire that we talk about other projects that can benefit the average person relatively soon, so this is the biggest piece," Mr. Richard said. Kevin, what are you planning on doing?" I have listed the five most promising initiatives currently underway at our company. After that, I flipped to the slide that listed the five most promising endeavors. "The data collected thus far informed the creation of this list. The Energy project is the first, and it includes both energy conservation and generation measures. I figured putting them together as one solid piece would be more illustrative of the whole. During the pilot phase of this program's implementation, we saw an increase in electricity savings of over 20% at the test sites. The combined output of wind, solar, and marine wave farms increased by 15% last year." In Mr. Richard's opinion, something wasn't quite right "However, most people don't place much stock in these figures. You really think this is our finest work?"

"Yes! It might help if we demonstrated how much money they'd save on energy." In my opinion, the most practical approach would be to make savings on an annual basis. He gestured for me to continue speaking while he spoke to his assistant. "However, our work on drug prediction models is our next-best endeavor. The first phase of testing the drug's effectiveness according to our AI models has been completed." I expected him to be uninterested, so it came as a surprise when Mr. Richard showed genuine interest. "What is this medication, and what illness does it treat? To make the drug seem like a miracle, we can portray the disease in a dire light." Mrs. Lisa chimed in at this point: "No, I don't think we should tell the public a lie like that. Since we are a nonprofit, global organization, we have no shareholders to win over. Share only the facts about this project."

Mr. Richard seemed less than enthused, so I waved at him and informed him of the next project. "The Recycling project comes next; as the name implies, it focuses on applying AI to the recycling process. For many years, recycling could not be maintained because the costs far outweighed the benefits. Rapid detection systems enabled by AI, however, allow us to break down all the material into its component parts in a way that significantly reduces the cost of recycling. This method is currently being used at two locations, with the potential to recycle 85% of the total value." It was clear that this did not make Mr. Richard happy, so I moved on to the next task "Among our many lucrative endeavors, the self-driving arsenal ranks high. Predictions based on our current findings show that the typical consumer product can be made for less than half of its current cost, delivered to the consumer in half the time, and supported by a more reliable supply chain." Mrs. Lisa's soothing smile helped me to relax, but I could tell that Mr. Richard was not on board. What he actually said: "Don't even bother displaying this awful work. Even though their lot in life has improved, many people are still bitter that their jobs were eliminated by self-driving cars and trucks. Why do we refer to it as a "self-driving arsenal," anyway? Do ships, planes, and drones not make up part of this project?"

"Unfortunately, the concept of pandemic prevention is still in its infancy, and we can't be confident in its efficacy until a worldwide healthcare system is in place, which won't happen for at least another five years. However, it has proven successful in simulations, and preliminary results from trials in the United States are encouraging as well. The system alerts medical facilities and doctors to rising disease rates in the population. It also monitors for the emergence of new diseases by looking for an increase in the frequency of previously recognized symptoms." Mr. Richard appeared to be more enthusiastic about it: "We agree, this is a solid argument. All of us remember how the Covid-19 pandemic messed things up. In other words, this is the sort of thing that would interest the general public if we showed it to them. Nonetheless, the autonomous driving gadget is terrible. Waste reduction through recycling is also undesirable. In general, people would rather not think about where their trash came from or how something they use today was once considered garbage. I can now say with confidence that efforts are underway to permanently end global hunger. We need to demonstrate this, so why can't we?" Still, AI was employed, right? "It happened long before the dawn of morally responsible AI. Back then, there was no such thing as our firm."

"This is irrelevant, as the food shortage is ending and we are working to implement AI in food production. For this reason, I believe it would be a good idea to publicize these initiatives as well." He addressed Mrs. Lisa directly: "It's not a lie to say this, either. Honestly, there's no need for me to exaggerate beyond the truth about what we do." When he finally did, he proclaimed: "At the very least, I see this as a beginning. There was one completed project and four in the works that look promising. The Universal Basic Needs and Global Healthcare initiatives are the most visible of our work, but I do not believe they hold enough promise to warrant our full attention at this time. I'm crossing my fingers that they'll be able to join us at the next Ethical Day event. Emma, please provide Andrew with the correct figures. My day starts early, so please excuse me while I go get ready." The moment he and his assistant left the room, I finally felt at ease this morning.

Mrs. Lisa and I also went our separate ways after that. I headed into the office to get to work on the assigned numbers. Without realizing it, time had passed and my stomach was now vocally protesting my lack of progress. There was a check of the clock, and 3 o'clock came up. Despite having only two hours to finish my report for Elon, I was unable to do so due to a raging hunger. As I hadn't eaten since the night before, I made my way to the cafeteria and placed an order for a lab-grown hamburger. My subordinate Robinson greeted me as I entered the office, saying, "Hey boss, you've been absent today." I have to complete the reports by the end of the day, and I'm not sure if I'll have time. When Robinson announced his completion and offered assistance, I accepted his offer without hesitation. I got the report done and off to Elon with his help just in the nick of time. After going through security together, Robinson turned to me and said: "The pressure of tomorrow's big day is enough to make you crazy today, so chill out a little. If you'd like, we can grab a cup of coffee. Relaxing with our significant others is possible."

Unfortunately, our proposed plan on the global warming solution met a deadlock, for the fact that climate change is not just a fight against too much energy consumption, but it‚Äôs also a fight against the market itself that‚Äôs the GDP because high energy consumptions leads to high increase in the global economic and high increase in GDP of nations. Our effort were kicked against by most the global government terming it as selfish driven project that doesn‚Äôt consider the ‚Äúwell-being‚Äô of the people. Similarly, More than ten years before climate change entered the public conversation, in 1977, the Exxon Company became aware of it. Exxon publicly denied the existence of climate change while encouraging the distribution of false information that minimized it. Its strategy is being compared to tobacco corporations' efforts to hide the real risks of smoking. Both sectors of the economy understood that once the risks and effects of their products were known to the public, they would no longer be profitable. Nonetheless, In accordance with the research, sustainable economic development must entail the preservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems that safeguard resources like fresh water and storm-resistant coastlines. According to numerous pieces of data, "effective and equitable conservation of around thirty percent to fifty percent of Earth's land, freshwater, and ocean areas" will be necessary in order to maintain the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystems as the climate warms. Until nations and individuals as a whole coordinate, agree and work upon a principle towards limiting global warning through: Sustainable agriculture & forest management, Sustainable infrastructure, Renewable energies, Sustainable transportation, Responsible consumption and recycling, Energy and water efficiency. There surely bond to be failure in our fight towards global warming and climate change.

I gladly agree to liscense my story to the pluriverse.wtf community.
