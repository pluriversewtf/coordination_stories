# The Moloch Beneath 

Author: Imran Sharif - twitter.com/imran_s_rizvi

I vaguely recall trying to desperately remember the lyrics or the rythm to the Stayin' Alive song as she pulled in another rasping breath. As I looked up, I was relieved to see that the ambulance was finally turning into the familiar street that led to the Shalamar hospital. Most of that early April morning is a haze for me now, but somewhere towards the end of that short ride to the hospital, I looked up to see my mother staring intently at me. She hadn't been responsive since she took her pills the previous night and I hadn't really "seen" her since then. That was the last time I saw my mother. I recall telling her that Abba was right behind us in the car and to hold on, as the ambulance careened into the hospital parking lot. I jumped off the ambulance and shouted at the hospital staff to hurry. I stayed behind to look for a doctor as the staff wheeled my mother into the ER. When I went in, my dad was sitting on a seat near the entrance, crying. In the months following my mother's untimely death. The memory of that cogent, conscious and deliberate last look from my mother stayed stayed with me. I often find myself wondering what was going through her mind at that time. Did she regret the life she lived?

My mother was a complex individual. I had always been a dutiful son. But I had never appreciated or liked the person I thought her to be. Growing up in a poor household in a conservative islamic country with neither looks nor a career to rely on, my mother was always extremely insecure in her relationships. Since early childhood, I remember resenting her for the way she manipulated my father and my siblings in order to get us to do the things she wanted. I had left home after highschool to pursue higher education abroad, but stayed back to stay with my family in the aftermath of her death. The period was extremely difficult for me as I dealt with some career setbacks and tried to be there for my family through our shared grief. For the first time in my life, I saw the rest of my family clearly, without my resentment for my mother clouding my judgement of their actions. For the first time I began to see the ways in which they too were responsible for our dysfunctional familial dyanmics. I have since learned to have more empathy for the life my mother lived. Yet, I can't help but be frustrated by all the pain her actions and ours caused. It is both painful and, I'm ahsamed to admit, satisfying for me to recall how the key events in the days leading upto my mothers death were a crystalisation of the ways in which each member of our family, including me, acted in ways so fundamentally reflective of our roles in the family dynamic and our deepests wants and desires. Each of us acted according to what was most important to us. But in acting along those motives, we each acted to bring about the worst possible outcome for ourselves. My mother wanted security and managed and manipulated my father to feel secure. In the end, my father acted in the way she had best taught him. But that failed her when she needed him the most. My father only wanted my mothers companionship and approval. But that will now elude him forever because he failed to have the courage to act against her immediate wishes. I wanted to be an impartial judge and act rationally in a manner that would not leave me with regrets, and I will now regret my obstinate conceit and doubt myself and my decisions for the rest of my days. If only we had the humility to communicate clearly and without the hubris of thinking we could unilaterally optimise our actions for the best possible outcome, my mother might still be alive today.

I have read a fair few stories and heard some excellent talks on the coordination moloch that plagues societal mechanisms. Yet, not many pay attention to the moloch that lies waiting beneath the hustle and bustle of our personal lives. In my earlier years, I spent a long time obsessed with the moloch above. The moloch that threatens the core institutions of our society and the scale of whose choas and power sways inexorably higher as society becomees increasingly connected and globalised. Yet, my mothers death has brough me the humility to see the moloch beneath. The one that each one of us must overcome before we dare to look up again.

Author's note: My mother died on the 4th of April, 2021. This is my personal story. I hope I was able to effectively communicate what these experiences taught me. My best wishes to the reader in their fight with Moloch!
